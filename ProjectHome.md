This application sends last.fm scroobled songs to your skype client using DBUS. Originally it was created to run on Mac/OS using a very simple applescript (you can find it on skype extras website searching for "Euterpe"). This application is more powerful and it permits to change username on each run. GUI is very very simple as I have just began to study PyQt4 library.
**Mac OS version needs bugfixing!**
In previous releases euterpe was a python shell script: this version needs error handling!
